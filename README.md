- **wordcloud** - Text visualization

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Jupyter Notebook (or Anaconda distribution)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tramakrishna3012/SMS-Spam-Classification.git
cd SMS-Spam-Classification
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Alternative:** If you're using Anaconda, most dependencies are already included:

```bash
conda install scikit-learn pandas numpy nltk matplotlib
```

### 3. Download NLTK Data (if required)

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

### 4. Launch the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook SMS-Spam-Classification.ipynb
```

Or simply open the notebook in your preferred environment (VS Code, JupyterLab, etc.).

## üìñ Usage Guide

1. **Load the Dataset**: The notebook includes a sample dataset for training and testing
2. **Data Exploration**: Analyze the distribution of spam vs. ham messages
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Follow the step-by-step cells for:
   - Data cleaning
   - Text vectorization (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)
   - Feature engineering
4. **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
6. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new SMS messages

### Example Usage

```python
# After training the model
new_message = "Congratulations! You've won $1000. Click here to claim your prize!"
prediction = model.predict([new_message])
print("Spam" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Ham")
```

## üìä Dataset

The project uses a publicly available SMS spam dataset containing:
- **Ham messages**: Legitimate SMS messages
- **Spam messages**: Unwanted promotional or fraudulent texts
- **Features**: Message text and corresponding labels

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing
   - Removing special characters
   - Tokenization
   - Stop words removal
   - Stemming/Lemmatization
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorization
   - Bag of Words
4. **Model Training**
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Random Forest
   - Logistic Regression
5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report
   - ROC Curve Analysis

## üìà Model Performance

The trained models achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages. Detailed performance metrics are provided in the notebook including:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions
- **Precision**: Reliability of spam predictions
- **Recall**: Ability to identify all spam messages
- **F1-Score**: Balanced measure of precision and recall

## üîß Customization

You can extend this project by:

- **Adding new features** like message length, number of capital letters, etc.
- **Experimenting with different algorithms** like deep learning models
- **Using different vectorization techniques** like Word2Vec or BERT embeddings
- **Implementing real-time prediction** with a web interface
- **Adding multilingual support** for non-English messages
