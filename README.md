# SMS-Spam-Classification
##About
SMS-Spam-Classification is a machine learning project built using Python and Jupyter Notebook to automatically classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham), helping users filter unwanted texts. The notebook demonstrates the workflow from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, leveraging accessible data science tools for an educational and practical solution.

##Features
Automated SMS spam filter using popular machine learning algorithms

Step-by-step text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming)

Model building and evaluation for classifying messages

Sample dataset and exploratory data analysis included

Designed for transparency, learning, and ease of extension

##Technologies Used
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

scikit-learn

pandas

numpy

nltk

matplotlib

wordcloud

##Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.x installed

Jupyter Notebook (or Anaconda distribution)

##Setup Steps

###Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/tramakrishna3012/SMS-Spam-Classification
cd SMS-Spam-Classification
Install required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, use Anaconda which includes most dependencies.

###Launch the notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook SMS-Spam-Classification.ipynb
or simply open the notebook in your preferred environment.

##Usage Guide
Load the dataset provided in the notebook.

Follow the cells step-by-step for data cleaning, vectorization, and model training.

Evaluate model accuracy and interpret results.

Use the trained model to predict whether a new SMS message is spam or not by providing sample inputs.
